This software is being developed on a Debian Linux system
with some testing on MS Windows using MinGW-64 and MSVC
2013. Developers and testers using other systems may
have to sort out any build issues on their own.


================================
BUILDING ON DEBIAN BASED SYSTEMS
================================

I. Requirements:
a. git:
    apt-get install git

b. cmake:
    apt-get install cmake

c. GCC (gcc, g++, GNU make) and other build tools:
    apt-get install build-essential


II. Cloning with git:
    git clone https://github.com/cbernardo/libIGES.git

III. Cloning the SINTEF SISL libraries: (only required if
     you wish to build with -DUSE_SISL=ON and do not have a
     pre-built library installed)
    cd libIGES
    git submodule init
    git submodule update


IV. Build: create a build directory and run cmake then make:

    CASE 1: building WITHOUT the SISL library; various tools
            and test programs which depend on SISL will not be built:
        cd src
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make
        (alt: "make -j 8" or similar to use multiple cores to compile)
    
    CASE 2: building WITH the SISL submodule OR a pre-installed
            SISL library which can be found by CMake's find_package():
        cd src
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -DUSE_SISL=ON ..
        make
        (alt: "make -j 8" or similar to use multiple cores to compile)

    CASE 3: building WITH a pre-built SISL library which cannot
            be found by find_package():
        cd src
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -DUSE_SISL=ON -DSISL_INCLUDE_DIR=PATH_TO_SISL_INCLUDE_DIR \
              -DSISL_LIBRARIES=PATH_TO_SISL_LIBRARY ..
        make

    OPTION: By default a release build is built; this can be changed by passing
    the command line argument: -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

    NOTE: Pay attention to the messages displayed at the cmake configuration
    stage to make sure that the SISL options are being configured as desired.

That's all; there is no INSTALL script at this point since
the software is still under development.

Most of the test programs will be in the 'build' directory
except for the 'idf2igs' tool which will be in the 'build/idf'
directory. To run the idf2igs tool:

./idf2igs -f some_IDF_file.emn

The resulting IGES file can be viewed in your favorite
MCAD software. SolidWorks will display the assembly
with colors while FreeCAD uses only grey.



=========================================
BUILDING ON MS WINDOWS WITH VISUAL STUDIO
=========================================

I. Requirements:
a. git: install your favorite Windows command line
   version of git.

b. Microsoft Visual C++ (in this example it is MSVC 2013, aka MSVC 12.0).
   If you do not have an MSVC compiler, try Microsoft's Visual Studio
   Community 2013 or Visual Studio Express for Desktop which is provided
   free of charge for users who meet Microsoft's criteria.

c. cmake: install your favorite Windows version of cmake

II. Cloning with git:
    git clone https://github.com/cbernardo/libIGES.git

III. Cloning the SINTEF SISL libraries: (only required if
     you wish to use the SISL libraries)
    cd libIGES
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

IV. Build: create a build directory and run cmake then make:

    CASE 1: building WITHOUT the SISL library; various tools
            and test programs which depend on SISL will not be built:
        cd src
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" ..
        make
        (alt: "make -j 8" or similar to use multiple cores to compile)

    CASE 2: building with the SISL submodule OR a pre-installed
            SISL library which can be found by CMake's find_package():
        cd src
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" \
              -DUSE_SISL=ON \
        cmake --build . -- /p:Configuration=Release /m:8

        Note: the configuration option may also be set to Debug;
        the /m:8 option specifies a maximum of 8 cores to be used for
        the compilation.

    CASE 3: building with a pre-built SISL library which cannot
            be found by find_package():
        cd src
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" \
              -DUSE_SISL=ON \
              -DSISL_INCLUDE_DIR=[path to sisl include directory] \
              -DSISL_LIBRARIES=[path to SISL Release (or Debug) library] ..
        cmake --build . -- /p:Configuration=Release /m:8

There is no INSTALL script at this point since the software
is still under development.

The programs will be in the 'build\Release' directory (or
'build\Debug' for debug builds). To run the programs you
will need to place a copy of the appropriate SISL DLLs into
the same directory.

To run the idf2igs tool:

idf2igs -f some_IDF_file.emn

The resulting IGES file can be viewed in your favorite
MCAD software.


===================================
BUILDING ON MS WINDOWS WITH MINGW64
===================================

1. install msys2 and run the w64 console
2. synchronize the package repository:
    pacman -Sy
3. install gcc/g++/gdb/make
    * search for candidates:
    pacman -Ss gcc
    pacman -Ss gdb
    pacman -Ss make
    * install
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-make
4. install git and openssh:
    pacman -S git openssh
    pacman -S python
5. Retrieve the source via git:
    cd && git clone https://github.com/cbernardo/libIGES.git
6. Retrieve the sisl code and patch it; the patch is only essential
   when building :
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    cd src\sisl
    git apply ../patches/0001-sisl.patch

    Note: The patch is only necessary for the MS Windows
    build using MinGW.

7. install cmake:
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
8. Configure and build:
  cd ~/libIGES
  mkdir build
  cd build
  (OPTION: No SISL)
  /mingw64/bin/cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/mingw64/bin/gcc.exe \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/mingw64/bin/g++.exe \
    -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=/mingw64/bin/mingw32-make.exe \
    -DCMAKE_AR=/mingw64/bin/ar.exe \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON ..
  (OPTION: with SISL)
  /mingw64/bin/cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/mingw64/bin/gcc.exe \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/mingw64/bin/g++.exe \
    -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=/mingw64/bin/mingw32-make.exe \
    -DCMAKE_AR=/mingw64/bin/ar.exe \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON \
    -DUSE_SISL=ON ..

  Note: most test programs will be in the build directory
  while the idf2igs tool will be in the build/idf directory.
  The programs must be run within the MSys environment to
  ensure that all shared libraries can be found.
